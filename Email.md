Hi XXX,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide an overview of my recent investigation into our datasets, including key findings, data quality issues and requests for additional information to complete our next analyses. This exploration is based on three key datasets:

1. User Table: Contains demographic details such as age and location, which are essential for understanding customer segments.
2. Product Table: Includes product-specific questions like barcodes, categories and manufacturers, which is critical for product-level insights.
3. Transaction Table: Includes purchases made by users, including detailed quantities, sales, etc., enabling us to analyze purchasing trends.

The relationship among the datasets allows us to link transactions to users and products. However, several data quality issues limit our ability to produce reliable insights, as detailed below.

**Key Data Quality Issues**
1. Unmatched records in the three tables.
    - 99% of the transaction records cannot be associated to a user who made the purchase due to unmatched user ID between the transaction table and user table. This severly limits customer-level insights.
    - Over 30% of the transaction records cannot be associated to the product purchased in the transaction. This impacts product-level analyses.
2. Data integrity concerns.
    - There are records indicating users under 18 and users over 100 (oldest: 124) years old. These values likely indicate data entry errors or placeholder values.
    - Potential time zone inconsistency exists in the datetime fields. Some timestamps indicating UTC time while some are not.
3. Ambiguous information. The units for the quantity purchased and the final sale in the transaction table are ambiguous.
4. Data cutoffs and potential anomalies.
    - A notable spike in the quantity purchased occurred on 2024-08-09, with 975 units compared to the normal daily range of 400-600.
    - The purchase activity drops in early September, likely due to incomplete data collection or data cutoff.

**Request for Additional Information**

To resolve the data quality issues and improve the accuracy of our analyses, could I ask for additional information and support for
1. Investigating missing user ID and barcode that cannot be matched among the three tables. I would like to confirm if the missing user IDs are due to guest purchases or data inconsistencies in encryption. If necessary, I can validate whether additional sources can fill the gaps in the data.
2. Clarification of the units of the quantity purchased and final sale in transaction table, and whether all datetime/timestamp fields represent same time zone.
3. Clarification of the user registration - whether only users above 18 years old are allowed to register.
4. Providing if there are events or data collection issues on 2024-08-09 to understand the unusual spike.

**An Interesting Finding**

Though we don't have perfect data to conduct analysis, I did get an interesting preliminary finding that I'd like to share. The data show that the key user groups driving Fetch's revenue are the middle-aged adults (35-44) and seniors (65+). They contribute to the highest sales. The 55-65 and 45-54 groups contribute moderately to sales. Younger users (25-34) have lower engagement or purchasing power.

This segmentation informs targeted strategies to further engage high-value groups while identifying opportunities to attract younger groups.

Above are the key findings and requests for additional information. You guidance on these issues ensures that we are able to provide reliable analyses and insights. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss these findings further or if additional details are needed.

Thank you for your support and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Jiaxi
