# Fetch Data Analyst Take Home Exercise
This repository includes the solutions to the Data Analyst Take Home Exercise.

## Instructions
The solutions to all the three questions can be found in the Jupyter Notebook named Fetch_Take_Home_Exercise.ipynb. The files in the repository are:

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). This file provides a list of packaged needed to set up for the Python environment to run the code in the notebook.

Under [Solution](Solution) folder:

- [Solutions_with_Static_Charts.ipynb](Solution/Solutions_with_Static_Charts.ipynb). This is main notebook that includes all code and queries, as well as in-line text summaries of findings and the email to the stakeholders. The charts are visible directly in the notebook on Github.

- [Solutions_with_Interactive_Charts.ipynb](Solution/Solutions_with_Interactive_Charts.ipynb). This is an identical version of [Solutions_with_Static_Charts.ipynb](Solution/Solutions_with_Static_Charts.ipynb) that generates interactive charts. Since GitHub does not support rendering interactive charts directly, this notebook will need to be downloaded and run locally to display the interactive visuals, which provide more information by allowing users to explore data points, zoom and hover for detailed insights. All charts and content are exactly the same as the other version with static charts.

- [Email.md](Solution/Email.md). A separate file for the email to stakeholders.

- [PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv](Solution/PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv). Data provided.

- [TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME.csv](Solution/TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME.csv). Data provided.

- [USER_TAKEHOME.csv](Solution/USER_TAKEHOME.csv). Data provided.
